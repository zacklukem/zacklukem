### Zachary Mayhew ðŸ‘‹
Student studying Computer Science at Purdue University

I love learning about [compilers](https://github.com/zacklukem/xlang), [computer graphics](https://github.com/zacklukem/gle), and [systems programming](https://github.com/zacklukem/weird-os).

My favorite programming languages are ðŸ¥‡ [Rust](rust-lang.org), ðŸ¥ˆ [C++](https://isocpp.org), ðŸ¥‰ [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), and I think :godmode: [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is pretty but I've never made a project with it.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [xlang](https://github.com/zacklukem/xlang)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots about cool computer science theory especially compiler theory mostly by reading lots of [Rust](rust-lang.org) compiler source code since I've never seen an open source project better documented before.
